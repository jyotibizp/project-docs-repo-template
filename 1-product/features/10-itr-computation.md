### **Document Generation – What It Means**

**Goal:** Save the CA from manually filling repetitive forms by automatically generating documents from uploaded client data.

**How it works in Finfelo MVP:**

1. **Upload client files**

   * Client provides **income statements, investment proofs, salary slips, Form 16, etc.**
   * Files can be in PDF, CSV, Excel, or TXT formats.

2. **AI/Automation reads the data**

   * The system extracts relevant fields:

     * Income from salary, business, capital gains
     * Deductions under sections like 80C, 80D, etc.
     * Tax already paid or TDS

3. **Pre-fill templates**

   * AI or template engine **maps extracted data** into standard forms:

     * **ITR 1 / ITR 2** forms (PDF or Excel)
     * **Financial statements** (income summary, balance sheet)
     * **NDAs / engagement letters** (for onboarding)
   * Basically, the AI fills the blanks in **ready-to-submit templates**.

4. **User verification & download**

   * CA reviews the pre-filled document in the **center pane viewer**.
   * Can make edits if necessary.
   * Exports to PDF/Excel and files in client workspace.

### **Why This is Powerful**

* Eliminates repetitive **manual entry**.
* Reduces **human error** in computation or form-filling.
* Speeds up **ITR computation workflows**.
* Allows CA to **focus on advisory work** instead of paperwork.

### **Example Flow in MVP**

1. CA selects client → opens workspace.
2. Uploads Form 16 and bank statements.
3. AI reads files → pre-fills **ITR 1 form** automatically.
4. CA clicks **“Review & Download”** → gets ready-to-submit PDF.

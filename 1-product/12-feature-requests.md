## üí° Design & Operational Notes

- All features are **client-context aware**; AI should operate strictly within the selected client workspace.  
- UI should remain **minimal, fast, and distraction-free**, inspired by Cursor.  
- Document generation must allow **review and edits** before final download.  
- Audit and logging mechanisms are critical for both **compliance** and **debugging**.  
- MVP should focus on **core workflows**; all post-MVP features are deferred until stable adoption.
